# Overview

This application shows roads usable for road bicycles (that means roads of either first, second or third class, cycleways) and footwalks where you can pass with a bicycle. It also allows you to search for points of interest (POI) and natural landscape in close proximity around roads. So you can use this application to:

- Show roads of selected types (roads [first, second and third class, excluding highways and tunnels], cycleways and footwalks) in set distance around line connecting two markers on the map
- Show POI of selected types (buildings [castles, cathedrals, churches, bunkers, city gates], food [pubs, bars, restaurations], accomodation [hotels, hostels, motels] and bicycle services [bicycle parking, bicycle rental, bicycle service] in set distance near filtered roads
- Show natural landscape of selected types (forest, park, water [streams, rivers, lakes, riverbanks]) in set distance near filtered roads
- Show N nearest objects (or N of each type) of selected types to bicycle marker on the map
Other features:
- Show both POI and Nature at the same time
- Clear map of existing items

The application has 2 separate parts, the client which is a [frontend web application](#frontend) using mapbox API and mapbox.js and the [backend application](#backend) written in [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), backed by PostGIS. The frontend application communicates with backend using a [REST API](#api).

# Frontend

The frontend application is a static HTML page (`index.html`), which shows a mapbox.js widget. It is displaying hotels, which are mostly in cities, thus the map style is based on the Emerald style. I modified the style to better highlight main sightseeing points, restaurants and bus stops, since they are all important when selecting a hotel. I also highlighted rails tracks to assist in finding a quiet location.

All relevant frontend code is in `application.js` which is referenced from `index.html`. The frontend code is very simple, its only responsibilities are:
- detecting user's location, using the standard [web location API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation)
- displaying the sidebar panel with hotel list and filtering controls, driving the user interaction and calling the appropriate backend APIs
- displaying geo features by overlaying the map with a geojson layer, the geojson is provided directly by backend APIs

# Backend

The backend application is written in Ruby on Rails and is responsible for querying geo data, formatting the geojson and data for the sidebar panel.

## Data

Hotel data is coming directly from Open Street Maps. I downloaded an extent covering whole Slovakia (around 1.2GB) and imported it using the `osm2pgsql` tool into the standard OSM schema in WGS 84 with hstore enabled. To speedup the queries I created an index on geometry column (`way`) in all tables. The application follows standard Rails conventions and all queries are placed in models inside `app/models`, mostly in `app/models/hotel.rb`. GeoJSON is generated by using a standard `st_asgeojson` function, however some postprocessing is necessary (in `app/controllers/search_controller.rb`) in order to merge all hotels into a single geojson.

## Api

**Find hotels in proximity to coordinates**

`GET /search?lat=25346&long=46346123`

**Find hotels by name, sorted by proximity and quality**

`GET /search?name=hviezda&lat=25346&long=46346123`

### Response

API calls return json responses with 2 top-level keys, `hotels` and `geojson`. `hotels` contains an array of hotel data for the sidebar, one entry per matched hotel. Hotel attributes are (mostly self-evident):
```
{
  "name": "Modra hviezda",
  "style": "modern", # cuisine style
  "stars": 3,
  "address": "Panska 31"
  "image_url": "/assets/hotels/652.png"
}
```
`geojson` contains a geojson with locations of all matched hotels and style definitions.
